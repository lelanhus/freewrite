## Execution Principles

### Atomic Commit Strategy
1. **One logical change per commit** - Each commit should fix exactly one issue or a tight group of related issues
2. **Descriptive commit messages** - Follow pattern: `FIX C##: Brief description of issue and solution`
3. **Build verification** - Every commit must build successfully with no warnings
4. **Test validation** - All existing tests must pass after each commit

### Quality Gates
- **Before each commit:** Run `make build` and verify clean build
- **After each batch:** Run `make check` and verify all tests pass  
- **After each stage:** Update reference document with resolved issues
- **After each phase:** Full regression testing

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup before major changes** - Commit frequently to allow easy rollback
- **Incremental approach** - Small changes that can be easily verified
- **Dependency tracking** - Don't start dependent work until prerequisites complete
- **Testing emphasis** - Add tests for complex fixes to prevent regressions

### Progress Tracking
- Update `CODEBASE_ISSUES_REFERENCE.md` after each resolved issue
- Maintain running totals of completed vs remaining issues
- Document any new issues discovered during fixes
- Record any architectural decisions made during resolution

## Estimated Timeline

**Phase 1 (Critical):** 15-20 hours  
**Phase 2 (High):** 20-30 hours  
**Phase 3 (Medium):** 25-35 hours  
**Phase 4 (Low):** 7-11 hours  

**Total Estimated Effort:** 67-96 hours of focused development time

## Success Metrics

- **Zero build warnings** after each commit
- **All tests passing** after each batch
- **No regressions** in app functionality  
- **Improved performance** measurable in critical paths
- **Enhanced stability** verified through extended testing
- **Complete documentation** of all changes and decisions
