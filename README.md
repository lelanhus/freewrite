if you wanna make an addition + pr,
or just wanna remix the app for yourself go for it.

- clone repo.
- install xcodegen: `brew install xcodegen`
- run `make generate` to create Xcode project
- run `make build` to build, or open Freewrite.xcodeproj in Xcode
- done -- you're up and running.

make changes on a pr and i'll run on my end and then build a new version :).
